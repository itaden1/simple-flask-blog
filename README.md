## Getting started
Simply download or clone this repo. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt

if Python3 is already installed:

cd /my-blog-name
git clone https://github.com/itaden1/simple-flask-blog.git
virtualenv my-blog-name-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
